Used for MBL (Hopkins patient) and updated to Python3 from the words/letters comparison RSVP experiment, but for rerunning the experiment, the old Python2 version is being used.

VERTICAL NOT EQUIDISTANT

configuration =  'vertical' #'horizontal' 
Why aren't cues drawing in situation of precueFrames

Only the first trial seems to be having timing errors.

## MBL

- Need to add SOA field to data frame and exclude longer practice SOAs from mixture modeling
- Should probably run him on a few dozen more trials in the hopes of bringing the SOA=-1 and SOA=+1 number of errors above chance.
